# Enhanced Sample Selection with Confidence Tracking: Identifying Correctly Labeled yet Hard-to-Learn Samples in Noisy Data

This repository is the official implementation of Enhanced Sample Selection with Confidence Tracking: Identifying Correctly Labeled yet Hard-to-Learn Samples in Noisy Data. 

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Training
- Code for sample selection methods is in [train.py](./train.py) and [./algorithm](./algorithm)
- Code for advanced LNL methods is in [train_CORSE.py](./train_CORSE.py), [train_dividemix.py](./train_dividemix.py), [train_fdividemix.py](./train_fdividemix.py), [./train_disc.py](./train_disc.py)
- [./script](./script) provides scripts to reproduce our results. You can run the 'test.sh' in each subfolder.
